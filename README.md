This is my repository for 3MTT Cohort 3 online learning activities facilitated by Darey io

## Assignment Summary 
I setup my tech environment by installing the Virtual Box, MobaXterm terminal, Git and Visual Studio Code. 

I downloaded and installed the Ubuntu but the Virtual Machine (VM) simply kept failing. A closer look at the native linux installations (Kali, Ubuntu and Kali-Linux) shows that Ubuntu generally seems to be failing on my system. 

My Github and AWS are very much in other and i have taken time to get familiar with the products and services as per your directives. 

Thank you.
